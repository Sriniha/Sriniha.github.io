        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My journey as a data analyst began during my under-graduation, where I built a strong foundation in programming and data analysis. 
          Practical experience through internships and projects honed my skills in handling large datasets, performing statistical analysis, and developing machine learning models. A significant milestone was my internship at CloudEdz, where I built and validated a predictive regression model on historical start-up data, enhancing stakeholders' decision-making efficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic. Post-graduation, I joined Accenture as a Software Developer Engineer, where I developed and launched APIs and automated processes, notably improving data accuracy and operational efficiency. 
          Currently, I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at Georgia State University, focusing on Big Data Programming, Computational Intelligence, and Natural Language Processing. As a Data Analyst Intern at Georgia State University, I analyze large datasets, create interactive dashboards, and identify key data patterns, driving improvements in reporting and decision-making.
